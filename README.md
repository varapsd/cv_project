# cv_project
There are two steps involved in this project<br>
Training and testing code is there in Experiment folder.<br>
For training and testing first take the there datasets from the drive links and download the datasets and keep in the particular dataset folder in the experiment. <br>
Dataset_celeb : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RmUuhvgHn-vMbXSDI5zy6wmzG931LGE3?usp=sharing <br>
Dataset_celeb_small : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1klY2T3m-vO2XXbZ49wH1PgBAzNUUW-Fe?usp=sharing <br>
LFW_Dataset : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YMOkcg4wo0YQajmUhA_Re8NBgVc84lSB?usp=sharing <br>
Then Download the Keras_Facenet.h5 model from the link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cHLkYwWDKs5POhfqXCt00vfCwMnmBH_A/view?usp=sharing and place in the experiment folder. <br>
For training and testing the datasets. change the train and test links in the notebooks and run the cells. <br>

# To run the live model. 
In the face folder add a folder with name and add a few images of same person in the folder. <br>
Then run the app.py .
